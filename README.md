For this project, we'll add 5 commands to a simple shell written in Go. 

The commands I have decided to add are:
   1. ls
   2. mkdir
   3. open
   4. pwd
   5. touch

## Steps to run

1. Clone repository:

2. Navigate a terminal to the directory where the repository is stored.
   
3. Build project using the command: 'go build'.

4. Run shell with command: 'go run .'.
